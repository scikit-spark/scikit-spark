class GridSearchCV(SparkBaseSearchCV):
    """Exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.

    Important members are fit, predict.

    GridSearchCV implements a "fit" and a "score" method.
    It also implements "predict", "predict_proba", "decision_function",
    "transform" and "inverse_transform" if they are implemented in the
    estimator used.

    The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized
    by cross-validated grid-search over a parameter grid.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <grid_search>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object.
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_grid : dict or list of dictionaries
        Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and lists of
        parameter settings to try as values, or a list of such
        dictionaries, in which case the grids spanned by each dictionary
        in the list are explored. This enables searching over any sequence
        of parameter settings.

    scoring : string, callable, list/tuple, dict or None, default: None
        A single string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.

        For evaluating multiple metrics, either give a list of (unique) strings
        or a dict with names as keys and callables as values.

        NOTE that when using custom scorers, each scorer should return a single
        value. Metric functions returning a list/array of values can be wrapped
        into multiple scorers that return one value each.

        See :ref:`multimetric_grid_search` for an example.

        If None, the estimator's default scorer (if available) is used.

    fit_params : dict, optional
        Parameters to pass to the fit method.

        .. deprecated:: 0.19
           ``fit_params`` as a constructor argument was deprecated in version
           0.19 and will be removed in version 0.21. Pass fit parameters to
           the ``fit`` method instead.

    n_jobs : int, default=1
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.

    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately
              created and spawned. Use this for lightweight and
              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    iid : boolean, default=True
        If True, the data is assumed to be identically distributed across
        the folds, and the loss minimized is the total loss per sample,
        and not the mean loss across the folds.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:
          - None, to use the default 3-fold cross validation,
          - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
          - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
          - An iterable yielding train, test splits.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    refit : boolean, or string, default=True
        Refit an estimator using the best found parameters on the whole
        dataset.

        For multiple metric evaluation, this needs to be a string denoting the
        scorer is used to find the best parameters for refitting the estimator
        at the end.

        The refitted estimator is made available at the ``best_estimator_``
        attribute and permits using ``predict`` directly on this
        ``GridSearchCV`` instance.

        Also for multiple metric evaluation, the attributes ``best_index_``,
        ``best_score_`` and ``best_parameters_`` will only be available if
        ``refit`` is set and all of them will be determined w.r.t this specific
        scorer.

        See ``scoring`` parameter to know more about multiple metric
        evaluation.

    verbose : integer
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    error_score : 'raise' (default) or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error.

    return_train_score : boolean, optional
        If ``False``, the ``cv_results_`` attribute will not include training
        scores.

        Current default is ``'warn'``, which behaves as ``True`` in addition
        to raising a warning when a training score is looked up.
        That default will be changed to ``False`` in 0.21.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.

    spark : boolean, SparkSession
        If ``True``, uses Spark, and uses ``SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()``
        to get it.
        If ``False``, doesn't use Spark, and acts like regular sklearn.
        If a ``SparkSession`` is provided that is used.

            'params'             : [{'kernel': 'poly', 'degree': 2}, ...],
            }

        NOTE

        The key ``'params'`` is used to store a list of parameter
        settings dicts for all the parameter candidates.

        The ``mean_fit_time``, ``std_fit_time``, ``mean_score_time`` and
        ``std_score_time`` are all in seconds.

        For multi-metric evaluation, the scores for all the scorers are
        available in the ``cv_results_`` dict at the keys ending with that
        scorer's name (``'_<scorer_name>'``) instead of ``'_score'`` shown
        above. ('split0_test_precision', 'mean_train_precision' etc.)

    best_estimator_ : estimator or dict
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

        See ``refit`` parameter for more information on allowed values.

    best_score_ : float
        Mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    best_index_ : int
        The index (of the ``cv_results_`` arrays) which corresponds to the best
        candidate parameter setting.

        The dict at ``search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]`` gives
        the parameter setting for the best model, that gives the highest
        mean score (``search.best_score_``).

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is present only if ``refit`` is
        specified.

    scorer_ : function or a dict
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this attribute holds the validated
        ``scoring`` dict which maps the scorer key to the scorer callable.

    n_splits_ : int
        The number of cross-validation splits (folds/iterations).

    Notes
    ------
    The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the left out
    data, unless an explicit score is passed in which case it is used instead.

    If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
    point in the grid (and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
    reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
    the dataset is large and not enough memory is available.  A workaround in
    this case is to set `pre_dispatch`. Then, the memory is copied only
    `pre_dispatch` many times. A reasonable value for `pre_dispatch` is `2 *
    n_jobs`.

class RandomizedSearchCV(SparkBaseSearchCV):

    RandomizedSearchCV implements a "fit" and a "score" method.
    It also implements "predict", "predict_proba", "decision_function",
    "transform" and "inverse_transform" if they are implemented in the
    estimator used.

    The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized
    by cross-validated search over parameter settings.

    In contrast to GridSearchCV, not all parameter values are tried out, but
    rather a fixed number of parameter settings is sampled from the specified
    distributions. The number of parameter settings that are tried is
    given by n_iter.

    If all parameters are presented as a list,
    sampling without replacement is performed. If at least one parameter
    is given as a distribution, sampling with replacement is used.
    It is highly recommended to use continuous distributions for continuous
    parameters.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <randomized_parameter_search>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object.
        A object of that type is instantiated for each grid point.
        This is assumed to implement the scikit-learn estimator interface.
        Either estimator needs to provide a ``score`` function,
        or ``scoring`` must be passed.

    param_distributions : dict
        Dictionary with parameters names (string) as keys and distributions
        or lists of parameters to try. Distributions must provide a ``rvs``
        method for sampling (such as those from scipy.stats.distributions).
        If a list is given, it is sampled uniformly.

    n_iter : int, default=10
        Number of parameter settings that are sampled. n_iter trades
        off runtime vs quality of the solution.

    scoring : string, callable, list/tuple, dict or None, default: None
        A single string (see :ref:`scoring_parameter`) or a callable
        (see :ref:`scoring`) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.

        For evaluating multiple metrics, either give a list of (unique) strings
        or a dict with names as keys and callables as values.

        NOTE that when using custom scorers, each scorer should return a single
        value. Metric functions returning a list/array of values can be wrapped
        into multiple scorers that return one value each.

        See :ref:`multimetric_grid_search` for an example.

        If None, the estimator's default scorer (if available) is used.

    fit_params : dict, optional
        Parameters to pass to the fit method.

        .. deprecated:: 0.19
           ``fit_params`` as a constructor argument was deprecated in version
           0.19 and will be removed in version 0.21. Pass fit parameters to
           the ``fit`` method instead.

    n_jobs : int, default=1
        Number of jobs to run in parallel.

    pre_dispatch : int, or string, optional
        Controls the number of jobs that get dispatched during parallel
        execution. Reducing this number can be useful to avoid an
        explosion of memory consumption when more jobs get dispatched
        than CPUs can process. This parameter can be:

            - None, in which case all the jobs are immediately

              fast-running jobs, to avoid delays due to on-demand
              spawning of the jobs

            - An int, giving the exact number of total jobs that are
              spawned

            - A string, giving an expression as a function of n_jobs,
              as in '2*n_jobs'

    iid : boolean, default=True
        If True, the data is assumed to be identically distributed across
        the folds, and the loss minimized is the total loss per sample,
        and not the mean loss across the folds.

    cv : int, cross-validation generator or an iterable, optional
        Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy.
        Possible inputs for cv are:
          - None, to use the default 3-fold cross validation,
          - integer, to specify the number of folds in a `(Stratified)KFold`,
          - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator.
          - An iterable yielding train, test splits.

        For integer/None inputs, if the estimator is a classifier and ``y`` is
        either binary or multiclass, :class:`StratifiedKFold` is used. In all
        other cases, :class:`KFold` is used.

        Refer :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>` for the various
        cross-validation strategies that can be used here.

    refit : boolean, or string default=True
        Refit an estimator using the best found parameters on the whole
        dataset.

        For multiple metric evaluation, this needs to be a string denoting the
        scorer that would be used to find the best parameters for refitting
        the estimator at the end.

        The refitted estimator is made available at the ``best_estimator_``
        attribute and permits using ``predict`` directly on this
        ``RandomizedSearchCV`` instance.

        Also for multiple metric evaluation, the attributes ``best_index_``,
        ``best_score_`` and ``best_parameters_`` will only be available if
        ``refit`` is set and all of them will be determined w.r.t this specific
        scorer.

        See ``scoring`` parameter to know more about multiple metric
        evaluation.

    verbose : integer
        Controls the verbosity: the higher, the more messages.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default=None
        Pseudo random number generator state used for random uniform sampling
        from lists of possible values instead of scipy.stats distributions.
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    error_score : 'raise' (default) or numeric
        Value to assign to the score if an error occurs in estimator fitting.
        If set to 'raise', the error is raised. If a numeric value is given,
        FitFailedWarning is raised. This parameter does not affect the refit
        step, which will always raise the error.

    return_train_score : boolean, optional
        If ``False``, the ``cv_results_`` attribute will not include training
        scores.

        Current default is ``'warn'``, which behaves as ``True`` in addition
        to raising a warning when a training score is looked up.
        That default will be changed to ``False`` in 0.21.
        Computing training scores is used to get insights on how different
        parameter settings impact the overfitting/underfitting trade-off.
        However computing the scores on the training set can be computationally
        expensive and is not strictly required to select the parameters that
        yield the best generalization performance.

    spark : boolean, SparkSession
        If ``True``, uses Spark, and uses ``SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()``
        to get it.
        If ``False``, doesn't use Spark, and acts like regular sklearn.
        If a ``SparkSession`` is provided that is used.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cv_results_ : dict of numpy (masked) ndarrays
        A dict with keys as column headers and values as columns, that can be
        imported into a pandas ``DataFrame``.

        For instance the below given table

        +--------------+-------------+-------------------+---+---------------+
        | param_kernel | param_gamma | split0_test_score |...|rank_test_score|
        +==============+=============+===================+===+===============+
        |    'rbf'     |     0.1     |        0.8        |...|       2       |
        +--------------+-------------+-------------------+---+---------------+
        |    'rbf'     |     0.2     |        0.9        |...|       1       |
        +--------------+-------------+-------------------+---+---------------+
        |    'rbf'     |     0.3     |        0.7        |...|       1       |
        +--------------+-------------+-------------------+---+---------------+

        will be represented by a ``cv_results_`` dict of::

            {
            'param_kernel' : masked_array(data = ['rbf', 'rbf', 'rbf'],
                                          mask = False),
            'param_gamma'  : masked_array(data = [0.1 0.2 0.3], mask = False),
            'split0_test_score'  : [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
            'split1_test_score'  : [0.82, 0.5, 0.7],
            'mean_test_score'    : [0.81, 0.7, 0.7],
            'std_test_score'     : [0.02, 0.2, 0.],
            'rank_test_score'    : [3, 1, 1],
            'split0_train_score' : [0.8, 0.9, 0.7],
            'split1_train_score' : [0.82, 0.5, 0.7],
            'mean_train_score'   : [0.81, 0.7, 0.7],
            'std_train_score'    : [0.03, 0.03, 0.04],
            'mean_fit_time'      : [0.73, 0.63, 0.43, 0.49],
            'std_fit_time'       : [0.01, 0.02, 0.01, 0.01],
            'mean_score_time'    : [0.007, 0.06, 0.04, 0.04],
            'std_score_time'     : [0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.005],
            'params'             : [{'kernel' : 'rbf', 'gamma' : 0.1}, ...],
            }

        NOTE

        The key ``'params'`` is used to store a list of parameter
        settings dicts for all the parameter candidates.

        The ``mean_fit_time``, ``std_fit_time``, ``mean_score_time`` and
        ``std_score_time`` are all in seconds.

        For multi-metric evaluation, the scores for all the scorers are
        available in the ``cv_results_`` dict at the keys ending with that
        scorer's name (``'_<scorer_name>'``) instead of ``'_score'`` shown
        above. ('split0_test_precision', 'mean_train_precision' etc.)

    best_estimator_ : estimator or dict
        Estimator that was chosen by the search, i.e. estimator
        which gave highest score (or smallest loss if specified)
        on the left out data. Not available if ``refit=False``.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this attribute is present only if
        ``refit`` is specified.

        See ``refit`` parameter for more information on allowed values.

    best_score_ : float
        Mean cross-validated score of the best_estimator.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is not available if ``refit`` is
        ``False``. See ``refit`` parameter for more information.

    best_params_ : dict
        Parameter setting that gave the best results on the hold out data.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is not available if ``refit`` is
        ``False``. See ``refit`` parameter for more information.

    best_index_ : int
        The index (of the ``cv_results_`` arrays) which corresponds to the best
        candidate parameter setting.

        The dict at ``search.cv_results_['params'][search.best_index_]`` gives
        the parameter setting for the best model, that gives the highest
        mean score (``search.best_score_``).

        For multi-metric evaluation, this is not available if ``refit`` is
        ``False``. See ``refit`` parameter for more information.

    scorer_ : function or a dict
        Scorer function used on the held out data to choose the best
        parameters for the model.

        For multi-metric evaluation, this attribute holds the validated
        ``scoring`` dict which maps the scorer key to the scorer callable.

    n_splits_ : int
        The number of cross-validation splits (folds/iterations).

    Notes
    -----
    The parameters selected are those that maximize the score of the held-out
    data, according to the scoring parameter.

    If `n_jobs` was set to a value higher than one, the data is copied for each
    parameter setting(and not `n_jobs` times). This is done for efficiency
    reasons if individual jobs take very little time, but may raise errors if
    the dataset is large and not enough memory is available.  A workaround in
    this case is to set `pre_dispatch`. Then, the memory is copied only
    `pre_dispatch` many times. A reasonable value for `pre_dispatch` is `2 *
    n_jobs`.
